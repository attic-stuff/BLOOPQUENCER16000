# BLOOPQUENCER16000

hello! bloopquencer16000 is an instrument for making crunchy, sequenced sound effects for games and other cool stuffs. i made it because i need to make some 1983 sounds for a game im developing, and it was heavily inspired by [bleeper](https://pixwlk.itch.io/bleeper), which was made by [cedric stoquer](https://pixwlk.itch.io). i've put it up on github so's you can download it and play with it, make some sounds with it, and annoy your mom with it.

## how 2 get it:

go  to the  [releases](https://github.com/attic-stuff/BLOOPQUENCER16000/releases/tag/v1.0) and  download the  zip file with the executable in it. this is windows only, sorry bubba.

if you are on a different operating system you are more than welcome to download the yyz file, open it up in gamemaker (2024.4+), and build it for whatever flavor you like.

## how 2 use it

unzip the release, put it somewhere and double click the executable. press T for a quick tutorial on what all the buttons do. long story short: click a wave shape, click the sequencer to place the sound in the sequence. the smaller the rectangle, the lower the note. press the play icon to make it doot, press the sound button to save it as a wav, and  the other to let you save/load bloopquences as json.

## how does it work

this thing uses animcurves as waveforms and writes pcm data to a buffer that you can save as a wav file.

## you should add something to it

no i shouldn't 

## what license is this thing
